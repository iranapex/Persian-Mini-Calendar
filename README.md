# Persian mini calendar

# About
This region plug-in displays a small calendar with the specified date highlighted. This plugin is a copy of Oracle's mini calendar that shows calendar in Persian. Current version is tested on apex 5.0.3.
The query must return at least two columns--a date and its label (other columns will be ignored). The calendar will display for the earliest date returned, highlighting all dates returned within that month.
